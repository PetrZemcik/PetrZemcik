- Hi, I’m @PetrZemcik
- A recovering former academic economist, I have been developing credit risk, financial, and macroeconomic models in a corporate environment over a decade now.
- I’m currently learning Python and Gen AI tools.
- How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/petr-zemcik-7340632/ and petr.zemcik@outlook.com
- Fun fact: My physique does not exactly suggest that I used to be a competitive swimmer in my youth and that I have been involved in masters swimming for the last couple of years. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
